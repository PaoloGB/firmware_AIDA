\chapter{Clock}\label{ch:clock}
The \gls{tlu} can use various sources to produce a stable 40~MHz clock\footnote{For some applications a 50~MHz clock will be required instead}. A \gls{lvpecl} crystal provides the reference 50~MHz clock for a Si5345A jitter attenuator. The Si5345A can accept up to four clock sources and use them to generate the required output clocks.\\
In \brd the possible sources are: differential LEMO connector LM1\_9, one of the four \gls{hdmi} connectors (\verb|HDMI4|), a \gls{cdr} chip connected to the \gls{sfp} cage. The fourht input is used to provide a zero-delay feedback loop.\\
The low-jitter clock generated by the Si5345A can be distributed to up to ten recipients. In the \gls{tlu} these are: the four \gls{dut}s via \gls{hdmi} connectors, the differential LEMO cable, the \gls{fpga},  connector J1 as a differential pair (pins 4 and 6) and as a single ended signal (pin 8). The final output is connected to the zero-delay feedback loop.\\
The \gls{dut}s can receive the clock either from the Si5435A or directly from the \gls{fpga}: when provided by the clock generator, the signal name is \verb|CLK\_TO\_DUT| and is enabled by signal \verb|ENABLE_CLK_TO_DUT|; when the signal is provided directly from the \gls{fpga} the line used is \verb|DUT_CLK_FROM_FPGA| and is enabled by \verb|ENABLE_DUT_CLK_FROM_FPGA|.\\
The firmware uses the clock generated by the Si5345A except for the block \verb|enclustra_ax3_pm3_infra| which relies on a crystal mounted on the Enclustra board to provide the IPBus functionalities (in this way, at power up the board can communicate via IPBus even if the Si5345A is not configured).

\section{Input selection}
The Si5345 has four inputs that can be selected to provide the clock alignment; the selection can be automatic or user-defined.

\section{Logic clocks registers}\label{ch:logicClock}
LogicClocksCSR: in the new TLU the selection of the clock source is done by programming the Si5345. As a consequence, there is no reason to write to this register. Reading it back returns the status of the PLL on bit 0, so this should read 0x1.
