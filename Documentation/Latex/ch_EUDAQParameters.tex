Not all parameters are needed; if one of the parameters is not present in the files, the code will generally assume a default value, indicated in brackets in the following document \verb|[type, default]|.
\begin{alertinfo}{Case sensitiveness}
    All parameters names are case sensitive!\\
    Please ensure to use the correct capitalization.\\
    A misspelled parameter will be ignored and its default value will be used instead.

\section{INI file}
\begin{description}
  \item[initid] \verb|[string, "0"]| Does not serve any purpose in the code but can be useful to identify configuration settings used in a specific run. As an example, the user can write a mnemonic such as `Testbeam\_April' or `2017\_10\_init' to help identifying a specific configuration. EUDAQ will store this information in the run data.
  \item[ConnectionFile] \verb|[string, "file://./FMCTLU_connections.xml"]| Name of the xml file used to store the information required to communicate with the hardware, such as its IP address and the location of the address map. The default location indicates a file that must be located in the \texttt{bin} folder.
  \item[skipini] \verb|[int, 0]| When this flas is set, the producer will skip the whole initialization phase for the \gls{tlu}. This can be useful to avoid disturbing any other piece of hardware connected to the unit, as it avoid re-initializing the \gls{dac}s, \gls{hdmi} connectors, clock chip, etc.
  \item[DeviceName] \verb|[string, "fmctlu.udp"]| The name of the type of hardware to be contacted by the IPBus.
  \item[TLUmod] \verb|[string, "1e"]| Version of the \gls{tlu} hardware. Reserved for future use.
  \item[nDUTs] \verb|[positive int, 4]| Number of \gls{dut} in the current \gls{tlu}. This is for future upgrades and should not require editing by the user.
  \item[nTrgIn] \verb|[positive int, 6]| Number of trigger inputs in the current \gls{tlu}. This is for future upgrades and should not require editing by the user.
  \item[I2C\_COREEXP\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x21]| \gls{i2c} address of the core expander mounted on the Enclustra board. This is not required if a different \gls{fpga} is used. See section~\ref{ch:i2c} for further details.
  \item[I2C\_CLK\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x68]| \gls{i2c} address of Si5345 clock generator installed on the \gls{tlu}.
  \item[I2C\_DAC1\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x13]| \gls{i2c} address of \gls{dac} installed on the \gls{tlu}. The \gls{dac} is used to configure the threshold of the trigger inputs.
  \item[I2C\_DAC2\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x1F]| \gls{i2c} address of \gls{dac} installed on the \gls{tlu}. The \gls{dac} is used to configure the threshold of the trigger inputs.
  \item[I2C\_ID\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x50]| \gls{i2c} address of the unique ID \gls{eeprom} installed on the \gls{tlu}. The chip is used to provide a unique identifier to each kit.
  \item[I2C\_EXP1\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x74]| \gls{i2c} address of the bus expander used to select the direction of the \gls{hdmi} pins on the board.
  \item[I2C\_EXP2\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x75]| \gls{i2c} address of the bus expander used to select the direction of the \gls{hdmi} pins on the board.
  \item[I2C\_DACModule\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x1C]| \gls{i2c} address of the \gls{dac} installed on the power module and used to control the \gls{pmt} outputs.
  \item[PMT\_vCtrlMax] \verb|[float, 1]| value, in volts, of the maximum control voltage for the \gls{pmt}s. For EUDET telescopes this should normally be left to 1~V. If the \gls{tlu} is going to be used with different \gls{pmt}s, then a new value can be used but the hardware must be tweaked accordingly by changing the voltagi divider on the power module.
  \item[I2C\_EXP1Module\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x76]| \gls{i2c} address of the first expander used to control the indicators on the power module.
  \item[I2C\_EXP2Module\_Addr] \verb|[positive int, 0x77]| \gls{i2c} address of the second expander used to control the indicators on the power module.
  \item[intRefOn] \verb|[boolean, false]| If true, the \gls{dac}s installed on the \gls{tlu} will use their internal voltage reference rather than the one provide externally.
  \item[VRefInt] \verb|[float, 2.5]| Value in volts for the internal reference voltage of the \gls{dac}s. The voltage is chosen by the chip manufacturer. This is only used if \verb|intRefOn= true|.
  \item[VRefExt] \verb|[float, 1.3]| Value in volts for the external reference voltage of the \gls{dac}s. The voltage is determined by a circuit on the \gls{tlu} and the value of this parameter must reflect such voltage. This is only used if \verb|intRefOn= false|.
  \item[CONFCLOCK] \verb|[boolean, true]| If true, the clock chip Si5345 will be re-configured when the INIT button is pressed (see figure~fig.\ref{fig:EUDAQGui}). The chip is configured via \gls{i2c} interface using a specific text file (see next parameter). After a power cycle, the chip is its default state and must be reconfigured to operate the \gls{tlu} correctly\footnote{As long as the unit is powered, the clock chip will maintain its setup, so the user can set this flag to 0 after the first initialization, in order to save time.}.
  \item[CLOCK\_CFG\_FILE] \verb|[string, "./../user/eudet/misc/fmctlu_clock_config.txt"]| Name of the text file used to store the configuration values of the Si5345. The file can be generate using the Clockbuilder Pro software provided by \href{https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/clock}{SiLabs}.
\end{description}

\section{CONF file}
\begin{description}
  \item[confid] \verb|[string, "0"]| Does not serve any purpose in the code but can be useful to identify configuration settings used in a specific run. EUDAQ will store this information in the run data.
  \item[verbose] \verb|[int, 0]| Defines the level of output messages from the \gls{tlu}. 0 indicates minimum output.
  \item[skipconf] \verb|[int, 0]| When this flag is set, EUDAQ will skip the whole configuration phase for the \gls{tlu}. When the user configures the hardware in EUDAQ, the board will remain in its current state and no configuration parameter will be written. This can be useful to avoid disturbing other pieces of electronics.
  \item[HDMI1\_set] \verb|[unsigned int, 0b0001]| Defines the source of the signal on the pins for the \verb|HDMI1| connector. A 1 indicates that each pin pair is an driven by the \gls{tlu}, a 0 that they are left floating (with respect to the \gls{tlu}). This can be used to define the signal direction on each pin pair. The order of the pairs is as follow:\\
  bit 0= CONT, bit 1= SPARE, bit 2= TRIG, bit 3= BUSY.\\
  Note that the direction of the DUTClk pair is defined in a separate parameter (see HDMI\_clk).\\
  Example to configure the connector to work with an EUDET device:\\
  - in this configuration the BUSY line is driven by the device under test, so it is an input for the \gls{tlu} and should not be driven by it (bit 3= 0)\\
  - TRIGGER line is an output for the \gls{tlu} so is driven by it (bit 2= 1)\\
  - SPARE line is used to provide control signals, such as the reset signal to initialize the devices at the start of a run (\texttt{T$_0$}). It should be configured as driven by the \gls{tlu} (bit 1= 1)\\
  - CONT is used by the \gls{tlu} to issue control commands and should be configured as a signal driven by the \gls{tlu} (bit 0= 1).\\
  Therefore the value of this parameter would be 0x7 (b0111).
  \item[HDMI2\_set] \verb|[unsigned int, 0b0001]| Defines the direction of the pins for the \verb|HDMI2| connector.
  \item[HDMI3\_set] \verb|[unsigned int, 0b0001]| Defines the direction of the pins for the \verb|HDMI3| connector.
  \item[HDMI4\_set] \verb|[unsigned int, 0b0001]| Defines the direction of the pins for the \verb|HDMI4| connector.
  \item[HDMI1\_clk] \verb|[unsigned int, 1]| Defines if the DUTClk pair on the \gls{hdmi} connector must be driven by the \gls{tlu} and, if so, what clock source to use. A 0 indicates that the pins are not driven by the \gls{tlu}. 1 indicates that pins will by driven with the clock produced from the on-board clock chip Si5345. 2 indicates that the driving clock is obtained from the \gls{fpga}.\\
      Example to configure the connector to work with an EUDET device: in this scenario the clock is driven by the \gls{dut} so the parameter should be set to 0.
      Example to configure the connector to work with an AIDA device: in this scenario the clock is driven by the \gls{tlu} so the parameter should be set to either 1 or 2 (by default 1).
  \item[HDMI2\_clk] \verb|[unsigned int, 1]| Defines the driving signal on the corresponding \gls{hdmi} connector.
  \item[HDMI3\_clk] \verb|[unsigned int, 1]| Defines the driving signal on the corresponding \gls{hdmi} connector.
  \item[HDMI4\_clk] \verb|[unsigned int, 1]| Defines the driving signal on the corresponding \gls{hdmi} connector.
  \item[LEMOclk] \verb|[boolean, true]| Defines whether a driving clock is to be provided on the differential LEMO connector of the \gls{tlu}. By default (value= 1), the clock is driven from the clock chip. If the value is set to 0 no clock will be driven.
  \item[PMT1\_V] \verb|[float, 0.0]| Defines the control voltage for PMT 1, in volts. The value can range from 0 to 1 V.
  \item[PMT2\_V] \verb|[float, 0.0]| Defines the control voltage for PMT 2, in volts. The value can range from 0 to 1 V.
  \item[PMT3\_V] \verb|[float, 0.0]| Defines the control voltage for PMT 3, in volts. The value can range from 0 to 1 V.
  \item[PMT4\_V] \verb|[float, 0.0]| Defines the control voltage for PMT 4, in volts. The value can range from 0 to 1 V.
  \item[in0\_STR] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Defines the number of clock cycles used to stretch a pulse once a trigger is detected by the discriminator on input 0. This feature allows the user to modify the pulses that are then fed into the trigger logic within the \gls{tlu}.
      A minimum lenght of 6.25~ns is provided if the value is 0. Any extra clock cycle extend the pulse by 6.25~ns (160~MHz clock). An example of the effect on the stretch setting is shown in figure~\ref{Fig:exampleExtendedTriggers}.
  \item[in0\_DEL] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Defines the delay, in 160~MHz clock cycles, to be assigned to the discriminated pulse from input 0, in order to process the logic for the trigger. This can be used to compensate for differences in cable lengths for the signals used to create a trigger.
  \item[in1\_STR] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Same as \texttt{in1\_STR} but for input 1.
  \item[in1\_DEL] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Same as \texttt{in1\_DEL} but for input 1.
  \item[in2\_STR] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Same as \texttt{in1\_STR} but for input 2.
  \item[in2\_DEL] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Same as \texttt{in1\_DEL} but for input 1.
  \item[in3\_STR] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Same as \texttt{in1\_STR} but for input 3.
  \item[in3\_DEL] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Same as \texttt{in1\_DEL} but for input 1.
  \item[trigMaskHi] \verb|[unsigned int32, 0]| This word represents the most significative bits of the 64-bits used to determine the trigger mask.\\
        A detailed explanation of how to determine the correct word is provided in section~\ref{ch:triggerLogic}.
  \item[trigMaskLo] \verb|[unsigned int32, 0]| This word represents the least significative bits of the 64-bits used to determine the trigger mask.\\
        A detailed explanation of how to determine the correct word is provided in section~\ref{ch:triggerLogic}.
  \item[DUTMask]  \verb|[unsigned int, 0x1]| This mask indicates which \gls{hdmi} inputs have an AIDA device connected. Each of the lowest four bits correspond to a connector (bit 0= DUT1, bit 1= DUT2, bit 2= DUT3, bit 3= DUT4). If the bit is set to 1 the \gls{tlu} expects a device connected and exchanging signals according to the mode selected (see DUTMaskMode).
  \item[DUTMaskMode]  \verb|[unsigned int, 0xFF]| Defines the mode of operation of the device connected to a specific \gls{hdmi} port.\\
        Two bits are needed for each device, so bits 0,1 refer to \gls{hdmi}1, bits 2, 3 refer to \gls{hdmi}2, etc. Currently only the lower bit of each pair is needed to specify if the device is in AIDA mode (\texttt{bX1}) or EUDET mode (\texttt{bx0}).\\
        Example: to configure device 1 and 2 as EUDET and the rest as AIDA, the parameters should be set to 11-11-x0-x0, i.e. 0xF0 (but 0xFA, 0xF2 and 0xF8 would also work the same).\\
        See also section~\ref{ch:IPBus_DUT}.
  \item[DUTMaskModeModifier] \verb|[unsigned int, 0xF]| This mask only affects EUDET mode. Each of the lower 4 bits correspond to a device. If the device is in EUDET mode, it can assert DUTClk to produce a global veto in the triggers. This behaviour occurs if the corresponding bit is set to 1. If the bit is set to 0, asserting the DUTClk from the device will not produce a global veto.
  \item[DUTIgnoreBusy] \verb|[unsigned int, 0xF]| This mask tells the \gls{tlu} to ignore the BUSY signal from a specific device, either in AIDA or EUDET mode. If the device is in AIDA mode, this means that further triggers will be issued while the device is busy. If the device is in EUDET mode, this means that the \gls{tlu} will not pause while they are in the handshake phase. In turn, this means that the device will likely receive events where the trigger number does not increase sequentially by one.
  \item[DUTIgnoreShutterVeto] \verb|[unsigned int, 0x1]| Set bit to 1 to tell the \gls{dut} to ignore the shutter signal.
  \item[EnableRecordData] \verb|[boolean, true]| if set to 1, enable the data recording in the \gls{tlu}.
  \item[InternalTriggerFreq] \verb|[unsigned int, 0]| Defines the rate of the trigger generated internally by the \gls{tlu}, in Hz: if 0, the internal triggers are disabled. Any other value activates the internal trigger generator with frequency equal to the parameter. Values above 160~MHz are coerced to 160~MHz.
