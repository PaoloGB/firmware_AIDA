\chapter{DUT signals}\label{ch:DUTsignals}
In the old versions of the \gls{tlu} the direction of the signals on the \verb|HDMI*| connectors were pre-defined. The new hardware has separate lines for signals going into the \gls{tlu} and signals out of the \gls{tlu}. See section~\ref{ch:hwDUT} for further details. \\
