Firmware for the AIDA TLU Hardware

This repository contains the VHL used to generate the firmware for the AIDA TLU, both versions V1C (T-shaped pcb) and V1E (rectangular PCB; the one most likely to be used outside the UoB lab).

# Scripts
The repository also contains Python scripts used to test the hardware. These scripts rely on a few libraries contained in the "packages" folder as well as on uHAL.
Ensure your python environmental variable is set to include the packages folder and that uHAL is installed on the machine.
uHAL can be installed from here:

# EUDAQ2
The best way to operate on the TLU is by using the EUDAQ2 tools.
Refer to the official EUDAQ2 page for instructions on how to install it.
